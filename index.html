                <p>Finally, you arrive. </p>
                <p>You are walking straight into the setting sun, and it’s almost blindingly bright, but this is the way the powerlines lead, and Chirek insists you keep moving until sunset. He doesn’t say it, but whispers spread through the trialcats that Chirek has started glancing over his shoulder more and more, anxiously watching the massive storm grow in the distance. It is weird that this storm has not ceased its endless rumbling since you fell back into your real world over five weeks ago.</p> 
                <p>The powerlines have been leading you up a steady slope for a while now, but the first of the group has finally started to reach the crest, stopping for some reason. When you finally reach them, your breath is taken away.</p> 
                <p>Ahead of you is the ocean. The sun is lowering into it, bright orange and yellow, sparkling off the vast expanse of sea. And between you and the sea is the ruins of an ancient human city.</p> 
                <p>The powerlines you had been following go straight into it. But there are more lines, too, coming from all different directions, all traveling into the distant city. You all stand there for a moment, marveling at the sight, before a few cats begin the descent down the slope, towards this place where you’ve been promised power.</p> 
                <p>It takes another half hour of walking to actually find yourself between buildings. As you had gotten closer, the powerlines over your head had gotten louder, pulsing faster and faster, before splitting into smaller wires and dispersing throughout the streets. You look around, follow some of the wires, looking for some sort of a secret to unlock. The sun is falling beneath the sea, and you feel like you should find something before night sets in. Chirek is leading the way, but he seems as lost as you.</p> 
                <p><b>“I thought--”</b> he starts, shaking his head. It almost seems as if he’s talking to himself. <b>“I thought there’d be...something more obvious.” </b></p>
                <p>As soon as he’s finished speaking, there is a quiet, distant rumbling noise. But not from the sky, which you’d grown used to at this point. It’s from something...below. </p>
                <p>Chirek’s eyes widen and his fur stands on end, but you can’t see why until he looks down at his paws. He’s standing on a circular metal plate, flush with the pavement. It looks like it’s quivering, and for a second Chirek looks up at you, starts to cry out-- before the hatch opens, swallows him whole, and snaps shut again. </p>
                <p>Someone darts forward to try to catch your guide, but they’re too late. It happened too fast. You make sure you aren’t also standing on one of those mysterious hatches, but the rumbling noise has stopped, and you don’t see anything else suspicious about these streets. </p>
                <p>“What are we going to do now?” someone says. </p>
                <p>“What if there’s no power here?” </p>
                <p>“Don’t be ridiculous-- what else would have taken Chirek?” </p>
                <p>“We need to find him!” </p>
                <p>The cats around you begin to bicker, and you notice right then, for some reason, that the sun has fallen, and the sky has turned from a bright orange to the soft purple of early nighttime. And then as the sun goes completely, it's as if color has been leached from the city. Lingering hues of the evening are sapped away, leaving everything bizarrely greyscale.</p>
                <p>It is when you are examining the sky that you notice… the city has come to life.</p>
                <p>You can hear noises coming from the buildings now. The soft sound of metal clanging together, of doors opening and closing, of voices floating through broken windows. It has a rhythm to it that, at first, you can’t quite pinpoint. But then you realize--it’s the same soft thrumming the powerlines had. </p>
                <p>After a few moments, the sky has gotten even a bit darker, and the city begins to light up. But not how you’d seen cities illuminated in books, but rather… with more <i>life</i>.</p>
                <p>There are suddenly odd plants snaking up the sides of the buildings that hadn’t been there moments ago, glowing soft greens and whites. Little creatures, unlike anything you’ve ever seen before, scurry out from the holes in the grounds and alleyways like rats, but they are all different, all varying in size. They are all semi-transparent, glowing different shades of pink and orange and blue and teal and just about every other color. You catch movement overhead, and see massive whale-like beasts drifting slowly between the buildings, high overhead, making soft, slow noises at one another. </p>
                <p>And then the doors of the buildings around you start to open, and the ghosts emerge. </p>
                <p>They are all sorts of different creatures, no two of them the same. Tall things with beaks that have to duck to not hit their heads in doorways. Long slithering creatures with nothing but whiskers all over their muzzles with ten legs. Two-legged insects that bounce and skit around. They all speak, all mingle like they haven’t seen each other in days. Hardly any of them pay attention to you, only the few closest glancing your direction, as if annoyed you are taking up space where they want to walk. </p>
                <p>This city is ancient, but it is anything but dead. </p>
                <p><b>”OH. MY. GOD.”</b> </p>
                <p>You turn around, and one of the ghostly creatures is staring at you all with a wide open mouth and four eyes widened in awe. It has four legs, and two arms in which it is clutching what looks to be a book of some sort to its weird, transparent chest. </p>
                <p><b>”AHHH!”</b> he squeals with absolute delight, and rushes towards you. You might have felt inclined to turn and bolt the other direction at the creepy creature, but it seems so utterly thrilled to see you there that you can’t feel threatened. <b>”You’re here! You’re finally here! Oh, just perfect, too! I was worried you wouldn’t make it in time.”</b> </p>
                <p>You have no idea what he means, but he clearly has no intention of explaining, words flying out of his odd mouth so fast you barely have time to think. <b>”You’ve already lost your guide, hm? Yes, I can see by the looks on your faces--no worries friends, for this has been prophesied since the stars first shone! You will find him again, I assure you, you will!”</b> He is almost too excited, it seems, to keep speaking for a moment. His spectacles have slipped down his nose, but he pushes them back up and composes himself.</p> 
                <p><b>"Right! So. You must already know this by now, but we believe you have come to our glorious haven to uncover the secret that lies here. As destiny has foretold! Not a single wisp here has been able to uncover it for as long as we have existed. When you uncover the secret, you shall find your friend! But hurry! You only have a few days left, after all!”</b> he chuckles to himself, as if he didn’t just say something quite ominous. </p>
                <p>You don’t have time to ask him to elaborate before he straightens up, his face alight with glee. <b>”Right, then!! Since I am the one who has found you, that makes me your new guide! I am Ludlow, and I will be reconvening with you every so often. I have a few people to contact...”</b> his eyes have a faraway look in them as he taps his chin thoughtfully, muttering to himself <b>“Oh no, the Witches will want to be hearing about this immediately!”</b> He snaps out of his thoughts and smiles widely at you. <b>“I must go now, but please, explore, look for what you must, I’m sure there are many things in this city that will have meaning to you. Oh, this is so exciting! Finally, the prophecy will be fulfilled!”</b></p>
                <p>Without waiting for another second, Ludlow spins and scrambles away, leaving you all alone and baffled in the middle of this bustling city.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="tab-pane fade" id="story2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="story-2">
                <p>As you all gather at the city square, word spreads quickly; the imposter has been found. And what’s worse— he’s more than a liar. He’s a god. He’s a killer. And his intentions still remain mostly unclear. </p>
                <p><b>Kaulu</b> sits perched atop a pile of rubble, seeming almost obnoxiously pleasant to everyone. If you knew him before, you know how odd it is to see him behaving in such a casual and comfortable way. What had happened to the shy, skittish teammate you’d fought monsters alongside with? Had he ever been real? What did he want with you now?</p>
                <p>Only adding to the uncertainty is Oordeel, sitting alone at the edge of the city square, glaring at anyone who dares get near. Despite his hostile demeanor, he seems just as confused and unsure what to do as you all do. He keeps glancing at Kaulu before his gaze scrapes across the crowd, as if waiting for someone to make the first move. Chirek, too, sits alone, avoiding any contact with anyone. His body is transparent now, and you hear the whispers; he isn’t real. He never was. </p>
                <p>After what seems like far too long, Kaulu stands and stretches. <b>“Well! Now that you’re all here, let’s get some things straightened—”</b></p>
                <p><i>“Why did you kill those cats?”</i></p>
                <p><i>“Why are you helping Helena?”</i> </p>
                <p><i>“Did you really create the Red Plague?”</i> </p>
                <p><i>“Who are you?”</i></p>
                <p>The questions fly out of the crowd all at once, voices overlapping and jumbling together. Kaulu’s eyes light up. <b>“So eager!”</b> he says, tail flicking excitedly. <b>“You’ve always been so sharp. I should have known you wou—“</b></p>
                <p><b><i>“GET HIM!”</i></b></p>
                <p>You aren’t sure who had said it, but it doesn’t matter— the next moment erupts into chaos. A surge of cats push forward suddenly. Mavikus and Arrow, who had been guarding Kaulu’s impromptu throne, are forcefully tossed aside. While Lucreta holds aside Mavikus, and Florian distracts Arrow, more cats rush forward. Dog and Muttonchops leap up the pile of rubble and slam Kaulu to the ground. The brown cat thrashes. </p>
                <p><b>“M-Muttonchops! C’mon! Y-you know me! It’s still me—”</b> Kaulu’s words cut off as Oliver steps forward, wind rushing around him, pulling the air right from Kaulu’s lungs. Kaulu thrashes even more, his back legs kicking out violently, but Hannelore lunges forward and pins him down more, just as Spencer leaps up to the pile, dagger glinting between his jaws. </p>
                <p>Kaulu sees the blade and begins to panic even more. He twists, yanking his front leg from Dog’s grip, and slashes his claws forward. The gust of wind smashes into Oliver face-first. The green soul is thrown backwards, slamming into Spencer and knocking them both off the perch. Spencer seems dazed, but Oliver is completely out of it.</p> 
                <p>Kaulu snarls. <b>“I thought friends didn’t kill friends, kid!”</b> he snaps, seeming furious now. He thrashes even more, wind whipping around, and Hannelore and Muttonchops are losing their grip on the struggling tom. </p>
                <p>Another cat leaps up; Milky. A cloud of sleeping gas emits from her mouth and envelops around Kaulu’s head. The imposter’s movements slow, and he coughs. <b>“M-Milky—”</b> Kaulu chokes, and shakes his head again, his eyes clearing. <b>“C-c’mon. You didn’t really think that would work on <i>me?”</i></b> </p>
                <p>The cats are losing their battle against the struggling cat, and more cats are pressing forward, ready to join or intervene, but it doesn’t matter. Because Spencer pulls out a small golden trinket; an hourglass. He turns it in his paws, and for a moment Kaulu’s eyes widen in terror. As the sand falls from one side to the other, Spencer almost seems to teleport; one moment he’s standing on the ground next to Oliver, and the next, he’s sitting atop of Kaulu’s chest with the dagger plunged deep into the tom’s heart. </p>
                <p>Kaulu gasps; deep and gurgling. The cats restraining him let go as he rolls over and stumbles, trying to get away, but blood pours out of his chest and he falls, collapsing at the edge of the rubble pile. He lifts his head shakily, his eyes wide with alarm and fear, and locks eyes with Milky. <b>“Milky,”</b> he gasps. <b>“Pl-please…”</b>
                Forcing the words out was too much; Kaulu shudders, then collapses, still. </p>
                <p>Silence hangs in the air for what feels like too long. One single voice breaks it. </p>
                <p><b>“You idiots,”</b> growls Oordeel, shaking his head.</p> 
                <p>And then Kaulu coughs again. It sounds so unlike him, like a voice is coming from something much larger than the scrawny teammate you’d all known. He picks himself up off the ground, the fur on his shoulders spiking. His limbs look unusually long, his ears too pointy. Had he always looked like that? Kaulu’s tail bushes, and you realize...he’s <i>changing.</i></p>
                <p><i>Pulling back the veil.</i></p>
                <p><b>“That... fucking... <i>hurt!”</i></b> Kaulu bellows, suddenly seeming so large, so ferocious. His tail whips around, and in a blast of magenta light, all the cats on the rubble pile are knocked backwards. The dagger clatters to the ground at Spencer’s paws. When Kaulu finally turns, a grin splitting his muzzle, he’s no longer a cat. </p>
                <p>A coyote. A god. </p>
                <p>His tail is made of what looks like stardust, and the scruff of fur on his shoulders has bright magenta and teal feathers poking out. Stars dance across the fur on his paws, and his grin, too wide, too stretched, swipes across the crowd as if he’s gauging your reactions. His eyes briefly land on Beet. </p>
                <p><b>“Beet! Hey, here,”</b> Kaulu says, pulling out Beet’s old hat and tossing it to the red soul. <b>“This is probably too small for my head now. But thank you, friend! That was the first gift I’ve ever received from a mortal. I loved it!”</b></p>
                <p><b>“Cut the bullshit, Kaulu,”</b> Oordeel snaps from where he’d shouldered his way to the front of the crowd. <b>“What are you doing here? What do you want?”</b> He tossed a glance at Chirek. <b>“How did you manage to create fake cats like that?”</b></p>
                <p><b>“Oordeeeeeeel!”</b> Kaulu sing-songs. His tail whips back and forth, scattering stars into the air. His gaze darkens. <b>“No one told you yet! Did you really think I was just some minor insignificant chaos god? After everything? You thought Helena created the Plague on her own? You think she gained the power to rip holes in the universe <i>on her own?”</i></b></p>
                <p>Oordeel pauses, looking confused and annoyed. <b>“I don’t have the patience for your riddles, mutt,”</b> Oordeel snarls. <b>“Why are you helping Helena?”</b></p>
                <p><b><i>“Jealous?”</i></b> Kaulu sneers, rising to his paws. He drops into a stance that reminds you far too much of a hunting crouch. <b>“Let me even the playing field.”</b></p>
                <p>Before Oordeel can react, Kaulu lunges for him. There is a brief, awful moment where Kaulu straightens up, holding Oordeel’s neck in his jaws with the black cat thrashing uselessly against the canine’s jaws. And then Oordeel’s entire neck begins to... <i>glow.</i> White light turns to gold, then shifts to green between Kaulu’s teeth, and Oordeel begins to cry out in agony. You’re sure he’s going to die. Kaulu is killing him. Oordeel is frantic, throwing his claws and what little powers he has left at Kaulu’s chest, but the coyote god doesn’t even seem phased. </p>
                <p>And then Kaulu tosses Oordeel aside like a ragdoll. The black cat lands in front of the crowd of cats, his body weak and shaking. Kaulu is watching him like a starving dog watches its prey die. Oordeel’s glowing neck only gets brighter, more agonizing, and more parts of Oordeel begin to glow— his back, his tail, his face. It’s blinding, unbearable to even look at, but you force yourself anyway; you watch as Oordeel’s entire body lights up, and you watch as...as he <i>grows.</i></p>
                <p>When the glow finally fades, Oordeel is alive. And more than alive, he’s standing, sure on his feet, looking healthier and more <i>real</i> than he had just moments before. A gold necklace adorns his neck, his tail vanishes into black smoke, his cheek fur looks like black clouds. And as he stands there, Oordeel opens his huge, pitch-black <i>wings,</i> and he smiles. </p>
                <p>This is Oordeel, the God of Judgement. And his wings are back. </p>
                <p><b>“Feel better?”</b> Kaulu snarls with glee. <b>“Believe me now?”</b></p>
                <p>Oordeel turns to him, and a smile stretches across his face. There is a gleam in his eyes that you can only describe as pure power— and Oordeel looks, for a moment, <i>drunk</i> on it. </p>
                <p><b>“You fucking fool,”</b> Oordeel says, his voice a mixture of disbelief and thrill. Kaulu smiles. <b>“Do you know what you just did? I can do it myself now. I can stop Helena.”</b> His paws begin to glow bright green. <b>“And this time I won’t hold back.”</b></p>
                <p><b>“I wouldn’t count on that,”</b> Kaulu sings, but the green has enveloped Oordeel, and then he is gone.</p> 
                <p>Kaulu stares at the spot where Oordeel had just been for a moment longer, then turns to the crowd with a grin. <b>“Oh, shit, you’re still here? Alright. Oordeel will be back. Until then! I’m sure you have some questions! Hold on tight!”</b></p>
                <p>The world around you begins to violently spin, and then it’s over, and you’re standing in a very different place.</p>
                </div>
              <div class="tab-pane fade  show active" id="story3" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="story-3">
                <p><b>As quickly as you’d been taken away, you were back in the city square.</b> </p>
                <p>Somehow the storm feels worse. Wind whips through your fur, rain batters your pelt relentlessly. It’s almost too violent, too loud, to focus on anything else.</p> 
                <p><b>”This sure is annoying!”</b> you hear above the wind. Kaulu. You managed to peek to where he’s sitting on his pile of garbage again. He waves his tail-- and the storm ceases. The wind stops, the rain halts. The flood water still laps at your legs, but otherwise, it seems like you’re in a pocket of calm. A bubble of calm, warm air is around you, but you can see the invisible wall protecting you as the storm outside batters against it. </p>
                <p><b>”Sheesh, I couldn’t hear myself <i>think</i>,”</b> Kaulu says, shaking out his fur. He glances around. <b>”Hmm. Wonder where Oordeel is...”</b></p>
                <p>As if on cue, there is a bright flash of green. When the light fades, Oordeel is sitting at the base of the rubble pile, heaving so hard his wings are trembling. He doesn’t look injured; just <i>exhausted.</i> </p>
                <p><b>”Oh, good, you’re back!”</b> Kaulu sings.</p> 
                <p><b><i>”Shut. Up,”</i></b> Oordeel heaves, a ferocious desperation pulling at his voice. His wings shoot a blast of wind in your face as he pushes forward, his claws outstretched for Kaulu’s face. </p>
                <p>To your shock, there is a flash of scarlet when Oordeel makes contact and leaves a scratch across the coyote god’s cheek. But that’s about all Oordeel can manage before Kaulu’s paw slams into his chest and throws him backwards, splashing back into the floodwater. </p>
                <p><b>”Oh, tricky!”</b> Kaulu laughs, and as you watch, the cuts on his face heal themselves. He wipes the blood away and shakes himself a little. <b>”But you know better than that. How’s dear old sister? Should we ask her?”</b> </p>
                <p>Kaulu waves his paw, and in another flash of light, this time golden, Helena is standing on the trash heap next to Kaulu, Dolores at her side. Helena is still small, frail, with white feathers poking out of her back. She blinks a few times, a dazed expression on her face as she takes in where she is, who she’s looking at. Dolores looks just as lost. Helena turns to Kaulu, and frowns.</p> 
                <p><b>”Ah, there you are,”</b> she growls lowly. <b>”Glad to see you’re still meddling in all this.”</b></p> 
                <p><b>”I joined the games!”</b> Kaulu explains cheerfully, a wide grin on his muzzle. <b>”As a cat! You just couldn’t see me. Good work, by the way, running a <i>literally killer</i> Trial.”</b> </p>
                <p>Helena hesitates, squinting. Her whiskers twitch. <b>”Oh, I remember. I remember thinking how odd it was that there was a lanky brown cat hiding in the back of everything that I could hardly focus on. I suppose that was you? Messing with my senses?”</b> </p>
                <p><b>”Yep!”</b> Kaulu confirms, grinning. </p>
                <p>Helena’s eyes graze to where Oordeel is sitting, her expression deepening as she surveys his wings. Something crosses her face, and she turns back to Kaulu. </p>
                <p><b>”What the fuck is this?”</b> she demands. <b>”<i>You</i> did this? You could do this <i>the whole damn time?</i> You gave him his wings back but not me?! <i>Dolores!</i>”</b> Helena hisses, turning to the old cat with a hiss. But there is something wrong; Dolores looks… transparent. Like Chirek. Like the wisps. Kaulu laughs gleefully. The old cat looks shocked, speechless. Helena pauses, shaking in fury, her fur bristling. She spins back around, glaring at you all. <b>”Guess I’m on my own now,”</b> she growls. </p>
                <p>With the slice of a claw through the air, Helena creates a thin red string. It was faster than you’d ever seen her create one; she was getting <i>stronger.</i> The fallen goddess lunges off the pile and tackles down the nearest cat she can get to; <b>Kismet</b>.</p> 
                <p><b>”Oh, how exciting!”</b> Kaulu laughs, sitting down to watch and glancing at the worsening sky. <b>”Just in time, too.”</b> </p>
                <p>Helena raises her claws, and you have a horrible feeling you know what she’s about to do; but before she can bring her claws down on Kismet’s throat, there is a flash of darkness as Oordeel crashes into her, throwing her into the water. </p>
                <p><b>”Get off me!”</b> she bellows, kicking him away, and for some reason, he doesn’t fight it. Oordeel backs off, then lunges again, tackling her. She yowls, her claws slicing through the air, creating strings every direction. <b>”Someone--<i>KILL SOMEBODY!”</i></b> she cries. </p>
                <p>Her cry is more than just a frustrated scream--there is a sense of power within it, as if she is throwing the command from her very soul. Something happens; her voice is more than just in your ears, it’s in your head as well. <i>KILL, </i>her voice says. You feel the terrible weight of that order. </p>
                <p>Suddenly there is movement at the front of the crowd. There is a blur of rusty fur as <b>Pine</b> charges forward. There is something… <i>off</i>… in his eyes. Without hesitation, he tackles Kismet to the ground as she tries to rise. Caught off guard, she is pinned under Pine’s heavier weight. He looks down at her, his eyes shining with power.</p>
                <p>And he sinks his teeth into her throat.</p>
                <p><i>“NO!”</i> the cry comes from everywhere and nowhere, from dozens of trialgoers. There is a flurry of activity, voices raised in shock and horror and anger and fear at what Pine had done. As the crowd heaves in confusion, there is more commotion from the front. A fierce yowl pierces the air, and the crowd draws back as two cats tumble forward, locked in combat. </p>
                <p><b>Nayelli</b> and <b>Syaoran</b> are thrashing together, claws shredding fur. With a mighty shove of her back paws, Nayelli throws Syaoran backwards. He hits the ground with a thud, winded. Pine crouches, ready to spring for him, but a blur of pale fur crashes into him with a shout and sends him to the ground: <b>Arcadia.</b></p> 
                <p>Syaoran levels himself up on his front paws, snarling at Nayelli. Thick shadow chains shoot towards her, attempting to bind her… but she is too quick. She dashes forwards like a black shadow, ice crystallizing on her claws, and swipes--</p>
                <p>Blood splatters into the water, and Syaoran falls.</p>
                <p><b>“YES!”</b> Helena roars in triumph. She kicks Oordeel in the face--hard--and he reels back, cursing. She scrambles to her paws and runs for the strings. Slowly the ghostly forms of Kismet and Syaoran rise from their bodies. They give a long look at the trialgoers--their last look--before turning and passing into the strings. They disappear… and the strings open.</p>
                <p><b>“Finally,”</b> Helena says with wicked glee. <b>“Finally I can take you<i> back.”</i></b></p>
                <p><i><b>“Wow!”</b></i></p>
                <p>The voice startles you--you had nearly forgotten about Kaulu, and where he sits on the garbage heap above the chaos. He sits back on his haunches and claps his paws together, a delighted chuckle splitting his muzzle into a smile. <b>“Amazing!! Wow, this has truly turned into a spectacle, hasn’t it? Couldn’t have asked for better theatrics… bravo, bravo!”</b> He gives tiny little bows to Oordeel, Helena, Nayelli, and Pine. <b>“I am impressed… however, I would like to see how you all react to THIS plot twist!”</b></p>
                <p><b>“Don’t--!”</b> You hear Oordeel begin to yell, anticipating Kaulu’s next move as the coyote god sinks into a crouch. But it is too late.</p> 
                <p>Kaulu leaps for Helena. His jaws lock around her neck and spine, and she screams in anger and pain. Pale golden light spills from between his teeth and wraps around her. He shakes her, fiercely, and tosses her away. She tumbles like a ragdoll to the ground and lies, unmoving, as the golden glow fades.</p>
                <p>Then, she gasps awake. And when she stands, a set of gigantic white wings unfurls from her back. Flashes of golden jewelry adorn her ears, limbs and tail. Small speck of golden light float, weightless, about her, and her eyes are bluer than you have ever seen them before.</p> 
                <p>Helena--the real Helena, goddess of purity and light--is back. </p>
                <p>Her astonished laugh is breathless with triumph. She stretches her wings wide, as if flexing them after a long sleep. <i><b>“Oh,”</b></i> she breathes. <b>“Oh how I have missed this <i>power.”</i></b></p>
                <p><b>“Kaulu,”</b> Oordeel snarls, glaring between the coyote god and his sister. <b>“You fool--what have you done?”</b></p>
                <p><b>”Made the game <i>that much more</i> interesting,”</b> he grins wickedly, satisfied. </p>
                <p>Helena, ignoring them, lifts a paw and flexes her claws experimentally. Her eyes flash to where Pine and Nayelli have subdued a struggling Arcadia. She steps up to them. <b>“Excellent work, my lightlings.”</b> She purrs to Pine and Nayelli. <b>“Your faith will be rewarded. And as for you…”</b> she looks down at Arcadia.</p> 
                <p>There is a flash of piercing, bright light. You hear Arcadia scream. When the light fades, you expect to see him dead… he is not. But there is blood dripping from his one good eye as he stumbles backward and collapses on his side, breaths fast and shallow. </p>
                <p><b>“Now…”</b> Helena pulls herself up to her full height. Her piercing gaze sweeps the trialgoers. <b>“You puny half-souls have been nothing but a thorn in my side. Now that I have this power, however…”</b> her tail lashes. <b>“Your usefulness has run its course. I think it’s time to <i>end you.”</i></b></p>
                <p>You notice then what hadn’t caught your attention before… that the floodwater which you had been wading in had been slowly pulling away, back towards the ocean. There was merely an inch of water left around your paws, and it too was slithering from between them, pulled back into the bay. The storm, which Kaulu still held back from the city square, was darkening. Out over the bay, the clouds looked like a thick wall, advancing towards you.</p>
                <p>But wait… that wall. It wasn’t clouds.</p>
                <p>It was <i>water.</i></p>
                <p><b>“Oh, dear,”</b> Kaulu says cheerfully.</p>
                <p>The wave breaches Kaulu’s calm bubble, and you hear the sounds of buildings being ripped apart and the screams of terrified wisps as the hundred-foot tall tsunami roars forward, crushing everything in its path. Helena leaps swiftly into the sky. You hear a shout from Oordeel, but can’t make out the words over the terrifying roar of the tidal wave. He shoots into the sky after her, and you see the two of them crash together like a clap of thunder. </p>
                <p>You have mere seconds. Seconds to know that the blue souls are no match for this wave, seconds to watch as the city is being washed away around you, seconds to know you can’t outrun this, seconds to catch your last glimpse of the bodies of your fallen trialmates.</p>
                <p>And then the tidal wave crashes violently upon you, and you drown in the rushing blackness.</p>

            <p>Hello all, and welcome to Trial 3: The Witching Hour!</p>
            <p>This Trial will be run much differently from every Trial in the past, so first and foremost we ask that you bear with us through any hiccups that will inevitably arise! </p>
            <h3>Trial Format</h3> 
            <ul>
              <li>There will be <b>no teams</b> in this Trial!</li>
              <li>This will be set up a bit like the interims where we have a number of location-based roleplay docs rather than separate team docs. Each player will choose where they want to go, with a member number cap on each doc.</li>
              <li>To secure your location, go to the doc you wish to participate in and record your character's name in the "Players" section of the doc header.</li>
              <li>Each location will have a number of <b>hidden quests.</b> To unlock the quests, you must explore or try talking to NPCs.</li>
              <li>Completed quests will give each participant a reward. The rewards will vary anywhere from pieces of information, items, or...something else.</li>
              <li>This trial will consist of alternating rounds of <b>night cycles</b> and <b>day cycles</b>.</li>
              <li>The quests can only be played during the night, called a night cycle, which will last around <i>five days</i> OOC--after every night, you will have a chance to gather with the entire group in the specified Trial 3 Discord channels and compare findings, theorize, and rest your characters during the daytime. These day cycles will last <i>two days</i> OOC, where you are allowed to take a break from roleplaying or do free roleplaying as you please.</li>
              <li>At the end of a day cycle, if your character or group of characters has an important piece of information or announcement they want to share with the entire group, post a brief summary in #findings.</li> 
            </ul> 

            <h3>Mod Placement</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>If you aren’t sure where you want your character to go, or you would just rather have us decide for you, leave a comment in the Discord channel #mod-placement.</li>
              <li>A mod will respond with your location placement.</li>
              <li>Your location will not be entirely randomized. We will have a secret method for placements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Gold Coins</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Each of you will start out with one Gold Coin. These coins will be used as the city’s currency.</li>
              <li>Some quests require payment to be completed. Some quests will give you coins as a reward.</li>
              <li>Coins can be shared with other players. If you have more than you need, feel free to give them to friends.</li>
              <li>If you have coins leftover at the end of the Trial, they will not go to waste! Find out at the end of the Trial what your leftover coins can be used for.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rules</h3> 
            <ul>
              <li>Like every other Trial, to be considered active and save your character from dying at the end, everyone is required to make 5 posts. Please put your post number somewhere on every post, to make it easy for us to keep track.</li>
              <li>You can only roleplay in <b>one location doc</b> at a time.</li>
              <li>For each new night cycle, you will be able once again to choose a new doc to participate in.</li>
              <li>Once you have joined a location doc, you cannot join another until the next night cycle starts.</li>
              <li>You can only join every location once, but you won’t have the chance to join every location or do every quest. Also try to switch up the players you’re roleplaying with every night!</li>
              <li>Checkpoints will be given no less frequently than every other day, but sometimes will come more often than that.</li>
              <li>Try to check your current doc at least once a day if you can to stay updated, but you don’t have to post every time!</li>
              <li>Try your best to communicate with your quest teammates if you are going to be inactive for a long period of time! Alert the mods as well.</li>
              <li>We are trying to keep this trial fairly fast-paced and therefore quests will not wait for players who are inactive. Please be accommodating to a teammate who has missed and needs help catching up if they need it! The mods will do their best as well.</li>

            <p>This is the place where locals come to have some fun. Along this crowded and bustling street, you see many lit up windows and signs advertising bars, shops, party venues, and theaters. The air is thick with lively energy, and you can't help but feel excited for what you might find.</p>

            </span>
            <p>This part of town, you sense, is not for the faint of heart. These streets and alleyways seem darker and more close, and those hanging around on street corners and under flickering lamps seem to give you suspicious looks. There are vendors buying and selling here as well, but with a sense of discretion that makes you wonder if what they're exchanging is strictly legal.</p>

            <p>It is quieter here and, you sense, more upper class. The buildings seem older, prouder, and more ornate, and there are several open parks for folks to hang out in. It is less festive here as well--you sense that most of the locals bustling around on the street have places to go and things to do.</p>

            <p>A carnival is in town! You see vendors selling wares, locals playing fair games, and performers putting on a show. Down by the water's edge, the festivities continue out onto the piers, where there are also ships docked and waiting to set sail in the morning. Beyond them is a vast expanse of water, and you cannot tell where it ends.</p>
